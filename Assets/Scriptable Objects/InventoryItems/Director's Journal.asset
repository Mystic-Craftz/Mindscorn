  - "<b>Day XXX</b>\nA strange <color=#FFD700>creature</color> crashed nearby after
    what looked like a <color=#FFD700>meteor strike</color>. \nBusiness was already
    shaky \u2014 I feared shutdown \u2014 when a group approached me with an offer:
    let them use an <color=#FFD700>underground base</color> beneath the hotel for
    their work, and I would be paid handsomely. \nThey said they\u2019d found something
    in the wreck and needed a discreet site to conduct <color=#FFD700>experiments</color>.
    \nI took the deal. It was the worst decision I ever made."
  - "<b>Day XXX</b>\nThe <color=#FFD700>experiments</color> continued. I was making
    money while they worked on that <color=#FFD700>creature</color> \u2014 I kept
    my hotel, and everything seemed fine. \nThings went on like normal\u2026 until
    one day, I found out that one of the people working there went <color=#FFD700>mad</color>.
    \nHe started attacking the others and <color=#FFD700>released</color> the creature,
    causing a massive <color=#FFD700>outbreak</color>.\nI tried to escape, but it
    was too late. That\u2019s when I saw it \u2014 the <color=#FFD700>presence</color>
    of that thing\u2026 overwhelming, terrifying. I lost consciousness. When I woke
    up, I was in my room \u2014 and I realized I had been <color=#FFD700>infected</color>."
  - "<b>Day XXX</b>\nI feel myself slipping \u2014 losing pieces of who I was. \nEvery
    attempt to escape was anticipated; it seemed to have a plan for me. The hotel
    is a ruin of horrors: many were <color=#FFD700>turned</color>, others killed,
    and some bodies were used to birth a <color=#FFD700>parasite</color>. I am less
    human by the day. \nI write this in the hope someone will find out what happened.
    I can\u2019t hold on."
