  - "I lost everything.\n\nThe job that built me. The people who believed in me.
    Anna. I thought I could fix it all by finding the story that would save me \u2014
    that one big revelation that would erase what I\u2019d done, or at least make
    people forgive me. I convinced myself I was looking for truth. I told myself
    it was for them.\n\nNow I\u2019m here, chasing a hotel that swallowed more than
    just secrets. I thought redemption might be found in exposure \u2014 that if
    I exposed them, I could be forgiven. I was wrong.\n\nThere are nights I can\u2019t
    tell where the guilt ends and the memory begins. Faces I erased keep coming back.
    I thought I could make amends. I thought one last story could make it right.\n\nIf
    anyone ever reads this: I did not come here for glory. I came because I could
    not live with what I helped bury. I wanted to be better. I don\u2019t know if
    that\u2019s possible anymore."
