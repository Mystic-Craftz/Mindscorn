  - "\nI\u2019ve done terrible things for the wrong people.\nI wrote lies, buried
    truths, and called it journalism. All for the money... for the power... for myself.\n\nPeople
    died because of me.\nAnd Grace \u2014 she saw what I was becoming long before
    I did. I drove her away, just like I did everything else that mattered.\n\nNow
    there\u2019s nothing left.\n\nThey say there\u2019s a hotel \u2014 a dangerous
    place tied to things no one can explain. People disappeared there.\nMaybe if
    I go there... maybe if I try to do something good for once \u2014 not for me,
    but for others \u2014 it\u2019ll mean something.\n\nMaybe then I\u2019ll finally
    have a reason to keep going."
