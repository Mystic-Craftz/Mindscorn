  - 'If you find this that means I am already dead.

    We barely made it out alive
    and hid here. We barricaded the doors. There is no other way out of here.

    They
    are at the main entrance we can''t escape. So close to exit but can''t get to
    it.'
  - 'There is no solid food here. Only wine and booze. Lots of booze.

    We were
    drinking them just to pass time and a way to ignore the thought that there is
    no escape for us.

    But it has been a whole day since we ate anything. My
    stomach hurts. We had nothing except booze.

    Never thought these luxurious
    drinks will feel so disgusting.

    Uhh, I want a steak.'
  - 'Does anyone even know what is going on here. I have run out of hope. No one
    is coming to help us.

    Some of us are starting to think that maybe we should
    just open the door and rush to the exit.

    Or atleast try to find some food
    in the kitchen.'
  - 'We have been divided into 2 factions now.

    One want to wait until the very
    end in hopes that help might arrive.

    The other want to get out and find
    a way out.

    They are soon going to open the door. We will shut it back as
    soon as they get out.'
