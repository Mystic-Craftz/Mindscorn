  - "<b>Date:</b> 21 August 1990\r\n<b>Headline:</b> <i>Royal Veil Evacuation Ordered
    Due to Imminent Meteor Strike</i>\r\nLocal Landmark to be Abandoned for Public
    Safety\r\nIn a statement released late last night, officials confirmed that the
    renowned Royal Veil Hotel, a popular spot for tourists and locals alike, will
    be evacuated and closed indefinitely. This unprecedented action follows scientific
    reports indicating that a meteor is on course to strike dangerously close to
    the hotel grounds. The government has issued an official evacuation order for
    the entire area, advising that all residents and visitors steer clear of the
    surrounding region until further notice.\r"
  - "The Royal Veil, located in the beautiful hills, was cherished for its amazing
    views, comfortable amenities, and peaceful environment. Guests frequently praised
    the stunning scenery and the calm atmosphere that filled the hotel.\r\nBut with
    the meteor\u2019s projected impact so near to this landmark, officials have prioritized
    public safety. The mandatory evacuation was executed swiftly, and local authorities
    are on standby to manage any potential fallout from the impact.\r"
  - "<i>\"We understand the significance of the Royal Veil to our community and to
    travelers worldwide,\"</i> an official spokesperson stated.\n\n<i>\"But given
    the unpredictable nature of this event, we cannot take any chances with human
    life. Safety must come first.\"</i>\n\nThe hotel now stands empty, its corridors
    silent and its gardens deserted, awaiting the meteor\u2019s approach."
