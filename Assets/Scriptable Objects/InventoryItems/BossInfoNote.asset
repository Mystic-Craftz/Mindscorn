  - "This document describes a containment <b><color=#FFD700>mechanism</color></b>
    located within the basement lab.\n\nThe system was created as a countermeasure
    against the entity discovered after the crash incident. It releases a special
    gas that is harmless to humans but deadly to the creature.\n\nThe entity is effectively
    <b><color=#FFD700>invulnerable</color></b> under normal conditions. <b><color=#FFD700>If
    the gas is not released, the creature cannot be harmed \u2014 the gas must be
    used to make it vulnerable</color></b>; once exposed, the entity can take damage
    for a few seconds. This process must be repeated until it is destroyed.\n\nTo
    use the <b><color=#FFD700>mechanism</color></b>, <b><color=#FFD700>press the
    switch</color></b> and <b><color=#FFD700>wait a few seconds</color></b> for the
    system to release the gas. After activation, it requires a <b><color=#FFD700>short
    cooldown</color></b> before it can be used again.\n\nIf anyone finds this\u2026
    please, use that <b><color=#FFD700>mechanism</color></b> and end it. If this
    thing escapes again, God\_help\_us\_all."
