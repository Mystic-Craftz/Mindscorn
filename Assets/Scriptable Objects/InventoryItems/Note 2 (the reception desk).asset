  - "<b>Notice to New Staff</b>\r\nWelcome to the team!\r\nAs you might\u2019ve noticed,
    we\u2019re located in an older part of the city, and power outages are a frequent
    issue here. To keep things running smoothly, it\u2019s important to know how
    to handle these situations.\r\n\r\nIn case of a power outage, the <color=#FFD700>backup
    generator</color> is located in the <color=#FFD700>basement</color>. Make your
    way down there and <color=#FFD700>activate it to restore power</color>.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your cooperation.\r\nThomas Greene"
