  - '<b>Day 1</b>

    My head hurts...

    Don''t know how I ended up here. Maybe
    I am dreaming.

    I feel like I have been here for a long time'
  - '<b>Day 2</b>

    Is it time to sleep yet. What is it I don''t know. What am
    I writing. I don''t know what time it is.

    Get a hold of yourself elliot

    My
    shadow moves sometimes I can see it from the side vision of my eyes. I try sticking
    to this corner where there is light. The darkness is alive.

    Coming to this
    place was the worst decision of my life!'
  - '<b>Day 3</b>

    Oh God Help me Please.


    Oh God Help me Please.


    The
    voices get closer every day. Their hands streching from the darkness trying to
    pull me in.


    Please. Please. I want to get out of here.


    <font="Metropolitan
    SDF">NO MORE</font>'
  - 'Oh these hands in the dark. I let them touch me sometimes.

    They feel nice
    and cold. It feels... safe.

    Safe to disappear.'
