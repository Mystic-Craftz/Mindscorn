  - "<b>Day 1</b>\nMy name is Samuel Porter. I am 43 years old.\r\nI woke up and
    found myself in this room. I don't know how I got here. I tried to leave, but
    I can\u2019t... it\u2019s like something is stopping me. The door is not opening.\n\nI
    can't see anything outside of the window. Its complete darkness.\n\nI just had
    a dream where I was at a funeral but all the faces where distorted. I feel like
    I had been there before..."
  - "<b>Day 2</b>\nI can\u2019t leave this room. I\u2019ve tried everything. If I
    manage to open the door all I see is a mirror refelection of this room \u2014
    a never-ending loop. I have to find a way out\n\nSomeone someone must find this\n\nMy
    wife passed away 10 years ago and I just saw her look inside the room from the
    door. I opened the door and there was no one there. It couldn't have been her.\n\nShe...
    is... dead...\n\nYou are not... REAL"

    You are still... just like the day I met you.

    My love
    if I saw you smiling every day for the rest of my life I would still never get
    tired of it.

    You have no idea how much I missed you.

    I just wish you
    would speak to me instead of writing these messages.

    I look forward to tomorrow
    just for you.'
